 # Example 1 - single block
 # Explicitly replaces a 1.12 block variant with the 1.14 flattened block
minecraft:planks[variant=oak] -> minecraft:oak_planks


 # Example 2 - multiple blocks
 # Replaces all 1.12 block variants with their 1.14 flattened counterparts
 # The 'axis' property is copied across like-for-like unless we specify otherwise
minecraft:log[variant=$0] -> minecraft:$0_log
minecraft:log2[variant=$0] -> minecraft:$0_log


 # Example 3 - multiple blocks & property name-change
 # Replaces all 1.12 block variants with their 1.14 flattened counterparts ($0 copies the variant name across)
 # Replaces the 1.12 'half' property with the 1.14 'type' property ($1 copies the value [top/bottom] across)
 # Properties that exist on 1.14 but not 1.12, and that have not been specified in the rule (ie 'waterlogged')
   will be copied over from the 1.14 Block's default BlockState
